## Week 03 Homework

The site I chose to talk about is [CSS-Tricks](http://css-tricks.com/).

After digging through a handful of my most frequented sites, I realized that the majority of them do not use HTML5 Syntax fully (if at all). CSS-Tricks, however, was more recently redesigned and updated to utilize the newer syntax. 

Aside from looking pretty, the website's structure is well thought out and architected. There are a few flaws that are apparent when you strip away the CSS from the page, but overall it is still very readable. It seems (for the most part) that all of these "types" of blogroll sites are still readable with or without CSS but I went with this site as my example simply because of the HTML5 it uses. 

As far as how disabling Javascript affects the website, it doesn't do much as far as accessibility goes. It does however mess with their Google Analytics.

Also this whole site is done on WordPress. Done. That's all I've got.
